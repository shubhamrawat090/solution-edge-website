PROBLEM: Trying to render svg's from a .ts file to react component using map. SVGs invisible.

SOLUTION: change className to class for some reason dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: svg }} was changing className to classname and nothing was working. Maybe because className is a tsx reserved keyword
